## üöÄ Features

## üìÇ How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Add/commit your `index.html` file to the root of the repo (or place inside a `/docs` folder).
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your repository.
5. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) and select `/ (root)` (or `/docs` if you used that folder).
6. Click **Save**. GitHub will publish your site at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization
- Edit `index.html` to update site content, posts, and projects.
- Replace the placeholder text, links, and meta tags with your own.
- To make the contact form work, connect it to a form service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io) or [Basin](https://usebasin.com).
