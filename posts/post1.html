<h1>My 2000s Micro-Guide to Making a Homepage</h1>
<p class="meta">Published Aug 12, 2004</p>


<p>If you want an honest homepage in 2004, you need: a guestbook, a bad animated GIF, a hits counter, and a carefully curated list of links. Use tables for layout if you must. Keep it small so your dial-up friends can load it.
  My name is Colby G. I am formost a Catholic discerning his vocation while on this beautiful pilgrimage to the heavenly realm. But I spend a lot of my time as a Stihl Tech at ACE Hardware in Eaton, reading great books (reading list to come soon),
  wrenching on my 1990 Lincoln TownCar and 1977 Ford F-150, and a myriad of eclectic pursuits.</p>


<p>Also: always include a link back to the <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>.</p>
